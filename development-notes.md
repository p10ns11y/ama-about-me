## Ask Me Anything About Me (AMA-about-me)

After completing `Langchain chat with your data` (uses ipython jupyter notebook) where I learned basics and fundamentals for LLM apps, I wanted to build simple app using TypeScript without taking any other course and just by reading docs and source with **intensional struggling**. I plan to take the other course which actually uses langchain.js later. Also I wanted to build it cost-effective (0 dollors so far) using free models and free plans of the services. Instead OpenAPI I am using Ollama for embedding, Chroma as vector store those runs locally in the machine and `Groq` for `chatmodels` (llm+chat) which has free plan for hobby project. Those are not mentioned in the courses and figured out myself.

### Done

- [x] Found langchain deeplearning.ai and learned core concepts
- [x] Completed a short course about creating a chat bot with personal/local data
- [x] Set up typescript project and figured out the structure of the library
- [x] Coded loading and splitting
- [x] Learned about ollama and it is free
- [x] Setup ollama locally
- [x] Embed and create vector store
- [x] Retrieve using in-memory and Chroma db
- [x] Feed retrieval chain to LLMs and did question and got answer
- [x] Displayed result

### TODOs

- [ ] Load different types of documents
- [ ] PDFs, text files, web pages (publicly available and sharable)
- [ ] Relevant Memoirs text
- [ ] Frequently asked questions
- [ ] No Personally Identifiable Information (PIIs) of others in the
      Answers
- [ ] Social handle links: x, insta, threads, fb (inactive, soon)
- [ ] When contact info requested such as mobile number, email (Show a form popup/modal or something, ask their contact info and reason and there will be a system where I can see such requests and click send if the person seems legit such as recruiters (linked-in profile) )

- [ ] Automation: Github actions (simple)
  - [ ] Docker
  - [ ] Docker-compose (ollama, chroma)
  - [ ] Infra level (terraform) - need paid api keys
- [ ] Transition from cli to Web application

  - [ ] Only one page react 19 app with QA support (use latest features whenever wherever it is applicable and introduce relevant link as needed)

- [ ] Image usage and creation\* (use limited existing or relevant images in the rendering result, expensive and protect against possible misuse)
- [ ] Speech to text (voice chat)

Advacned learning TODOs:

- [ ] Learn more about embedding (latent-positioning) mathematically (theoritical)
